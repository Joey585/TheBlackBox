Update 12/12/22

Started messing around with the flipper API and created an extra page on the about.c in settings. I will work my way up to making the custom app for the black box.

My next goals are to improve api knowledge and do some more research about battery management systems, which seems that not a lot of people know about.

I forgot to mention that the black box will ALSO be checking my mood 3 times during the day. I will be doing this by creating a discord bot to check in every 5 hours or so to see what my mood is. (This won't be any problem to make)
