I have done more flipper app development and managed to create my own application that prints text. I have finished my pre part research and have created a parts list with the price and budget. All of this info will be stored in the github.
I have decided to use a LiPo battery with 100mAh and a battery charger that's actually very small
A rough sketch has been created, refer to github. It is nothing special and it was created on my chromebook lol
